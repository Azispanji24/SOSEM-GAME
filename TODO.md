# TODO: Fix Zoom Issue on GitHub Pages for Perasaan Game

## Tasks

- [x] Update game/perasaan-hari-ini/perasaan.css: Replace large fixed px/rem with flexible vmin/vw units, adjust media queries for proportional scaling, fix .result positioning.
- [x] Update game/perasaan-hari-ini/perasaan.js: Reduce base radius and multipliers to prevent off-screen positioning on mobile.
- [ ] Test changes locally by opening perasaan.html in browser.
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub and verify on GitHub Pages (test on mobile if possible).
- [ ] If other games have similar issues, check and fix them (e.g., aku-takut, cocokan-gambar, puzzle-emosi).
